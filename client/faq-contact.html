				<li><h5>I created a story but it doesn't show in the search results, why?</h5>
					<p>If you're sure all the fields apply to your story, check if it has any words. It won't show up until it does.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>I created a story, how do I add chapters to it?</h5>
					<p>After you create a story you'll be redirected to your profile where you'll find it. Open it, then click 'Add Chapter'.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>I edited my chapter/story but the update date didn't change, is that a bug?</h5>
					<p>No, it's a feature. Update dates only change when you add a chapter, mainly for sorting and to alert people of new additions.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>How do I delete a chapter?</h5>
					<p>Go to your story page, or the individual chapter page, and click on 'Edit Chapter'. There, you'll find a delete button.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>What's the difference between likes and follows?</h5>
					<p><b>Like: </b>Show appreciation for the story and show it off on your profile.</p>
					<p><b>Follow: </b>Get notified whenever this story has new chapters.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>Who can see my likes/follows?</h5>
					<p><b>Likes: </b>Everyone who visits your profile.</p>
					<p><b>Follows: </b>Just you. And when you follow a story, the author gets notified. But no one else. Promise.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>Why can't I like or follow my own stories?</h5>
					<p>Why would you?</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>Why are there ratings for stories?</h5>
					<p>To make sure everyone's comfortable reading and writing whatever they'd want to read/write. We don't collect age data and restrict accordingly, it's just there to improve the reading experience.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5>I have an issue I'd like to report.</h5>
